Paper: “Visual Sentiment Analysis for Review Images with Item-Oriented and User-Oriented CNN” Code: https://github.com/PreferredAI/vs-cnn 

Objective: “A picture is worth a thousand words”, today’s reviews contain more than text. For instance, reviews on restaurants often contain pictures showing specific food that people commented on. Thus those reviews are naturally “multimodal”. The goal of this project is to explore sentiment expressed in reviews with images for multiple types of business from Google Local Dataset. 

There are four steps to achieve the goal: 

1. Get familiar with the Google Local Dataset and prepare a dataset for the visual sentiment analysis task, following “Visual Sentiment Analysis for Review Images with Item-Oriented and User-Oriented CNN”. Think about two specific types of businesses that are suitable for visual sentiment analysis. There must be a strong motivation behind the selected types of businesses. For instance, you can check the “category” field from metadata and rank categories by the number of reviews containing images. 

2. Replicate the two models and case studies in “Visual Sentiment Analysis for Review Images with Item-Oriented and User-Oriented CNN” on the dataset created from Step 1. Report your findings, i.e.,  the kind of review images that connote positive or negative sentiment visually.
